# Project: To-Do List App
This project contains the code to run an interactive to-do task manager designed, an application aimed to reinforce basic front-end design principles and the use of JavaScript for real-time updates and user interactivity through the use of DOM elements and event listeners.

## Core Features
* **Task Creation**: Users can add new tasks using an input field and button.
* **Task Deletion**: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
* **Task Completion**: Tasks can be marked as completed, which updates their status and statistics.
* **Task Filtering**: Tasks can be filtered without refreshing the page using a search field.
* **Task Statistics**: The app displays the number of in-progress and completed tasks.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)

## JavaScript Functions Implemented


* `addTask()`: Handles adding a new task to the list, including validation.
* `createTaskElement()`: Creates and returns a DOM element representing a task.
* `filterTasks()`: Filters visible tasks based on the search input.
* `handleTaskButton()`: Handles click events for deleting or completing tasks.
* `updateStats()`: Updates the counters for in-progress and completed tasks.
